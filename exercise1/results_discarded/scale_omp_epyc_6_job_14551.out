A request for multiple cpus-per-proc was given, but a conflicting binding
policy was specified:

  #cpus-per-proc:  128
  type of cpus:    cores as cpus
  binding policy given: SOCKET

The correct binding policy for the given type of cpu is:

  correct binding policy:  bind-to core

This is the binding policy we would apply by default for this
situation, so no binding need be specified. Please correct the
situation and try again.
